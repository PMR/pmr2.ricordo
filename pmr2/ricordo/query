We need to avoid using web services to autocomplete things.  Try

    select ?s ?p
    from <http://models.example.com/go.owl>
    from <http://models.example.com/fma.owl>
    where {
        ?s <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> ?p
        filter regex(?p, "plasma membrane", "i") .
    };

The above would search for anything like plasma membrane in the label for
the ontologies involved.
